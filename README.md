This project aims to provide a compact, easy to use, relatively high resolution and arguably cheap encoder. It uses the AS5040 magnetic rotary encoder IC from Austria Microsystems.

Included are.stl and .step files for the case, and .sch and .brd for the PCB.

The PCB is double sided and measures 20 x 20 mm. It could be home etched or manufactured using some low cost prototyping service. The case is designed to be milled, 3D printed or laser cut (the top part).
